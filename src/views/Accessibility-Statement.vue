                This is an accessibility statement from <span class="basic-information organization-name">Rocket Downrange</span>.  It is of our belief that every person has the right to live with dignity, equality, comfort and independence - and to allow seamless, accessible and unhindered use for all.

                In an ongoing effort to continually improve and remediate accessibility issues, we scan Rocket Downrange with Google Lighthouse.  We also utilize UserWay's Accessibility Scanner to identify and fix every possible accessibility barrier on our site. Despite our efforts to make all pages and content fully accessible, some content may not have yet been fully adapted to the strictest accessibility standards. This may be a result of not having found or identified the most appropriate technological solution.

                    At Rocket Downrange, we are never influenced by issues regarding race, gender, creed, color, age or disability.  We believe that everyone deserves a safe, stable, and secure experience online.

It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.
