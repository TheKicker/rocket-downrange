                On Wednesday, June 30th of 2021, Astra became the first launch company to be traded publically on NASDAQ.  Trading under the ticker <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/astr" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="TRADE">$ASTR</a>, with shares previously listed under the special purpose acquisition company Holicity, the announcement expects to bring in around $500 million in proceeds. Astra's idea is to use the funding to continue to develop their rockets - with a goal of launching as many of it's 40ft tall rockets as it can, aiming to launch one per day by 2025.

                “Now we have a space company that everyone can invest in on the public markets,” Astra CEO Chris Kemp told CNBC. “The same kinds of things you do to make a rocket great are the same behaviors that you have to invest in to make a company great. You don’t want any inefficiencies.”
